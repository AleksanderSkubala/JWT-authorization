# JWT-authorization

A simple example of JWT authorization (with really big help of my friend [Adam Siekierski](https://github.com/AdamSiekierski) <3 )

# What you have to do

If you want to use this example as base in your project, you have to:
  - pull this repo
  - install modules
  - add `.env` file
  - set package.json as you want to
  - run `npm develop`
  - HAVE FUN !!!

That's all what you have to do!

### .env

It is scheme of .env file

```
JWT_KEY=your_secret_key
DB_NAME=name_of_your_db
DB_PASS=password_to_db
```

(You have to change host in database.js too)
